# SDSU Launch Control System
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

# Developed by: Jacob Dodson
# Developed in: 2015-2016

# To use SDSU LCS, open the .exe file in the file folder. Upon opening,
# enter the IP address of the Launch Control Server that you wish to 
# connect to. From here, you should be able to use all functionality
# that is present in the GUI.

# New Upcoming Features:
# 1) Ability to ping launch control server to troubleshoot connection
# 2) Flight Control Computer interface w/ ability to enter MANUAL or 
# AUTOMATIC operational modes
# 3) Ability to test and manually control the RCS as well as set up for
# AUTOMATIC flight mode

# For questions and concerns with the FCC and Launch Control Server,
# view Python scripts pertaining to those boards. Each of those pieces 
# of software include instructions for their individual operation.
